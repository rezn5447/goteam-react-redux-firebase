# README

This application is a rebuilding of the Go Team Final Project @ DBC
Originally a decoupled Rails application, considering the needs of the project and its matchmaking properties, I decided to redo this project to learn more about React, Redux, and Firebase as a backend data service.

I spent the first month after graduating from Dev bootcamp learning the skills to re-create our final project using Reactjs, redux for data flow, and firebase realtime database for OAuth, and realtime updates.

It is still a work in progess because I am the only one working on it, but I have learned a lot and plan to complete this project fully.

This React project has :
- React Router
- Redux
- Firebase Realtime database
- Webpack
- Babel
- Scss


# Concept & Introduction

It is generally difficult to find casual pick-up games across most recreational activities, and more often than not, the skill variance amongst atheletes greatly reduce the overall quality of such games.

This application is meant to provide matchmaking service and automation for casual athletes across all popular sports with an exciting and easy to use interface.
