This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>
You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

I spent the first month after graduating from Dev bootcamp learning the skills to re-create our final project using Reactjs, redux for data flow, and firebase realtime database for OAuth, and realtime updates. Right now so far this is just the skeleton. Updates will be happening swiftly and shortly =)

# README

This application is a rails front end portion of the Go Team Final Project @ DBC

# Concept & Introduction

It is generally difficult to find casual pick-up games across most recreational activities, and more often than not, the skill variance amongst atheletes greatly reduce the overall quality of such games.

This application is meant to provide matchmaking service and automation for casual athletes across all popular sports with an exciting and easy to use interface.
